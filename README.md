# Data-Analysis
Personal Project being built along with Integrated Quantitative Statistics Course Work

This is a personal project. As I learn new data analysis methods I will be working on making them scaleable to more effective uses in python. I will be using it for data inputted in csv formate hopefully. Plan is to develop functions then create runner code to allow for easy use

Topics Covered:

Topics Working on:
Plotting Data
Plotting Derivatives
Plotting Integrals
Linear Equation Solver
Linear Function Approximation
Quadratic Function Approximation
Least Squares Method of Approximation with error
Multivariable Lease Squares MEthods
Newtons MEthod of Approximation
